# Rainfall-Prediction-Website-Using-ML-
Rainfall Prediction Website (ML, Python, React): A web-based system using ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict rainfall from weather parameters, providing accurate, visual forecasts for agriculture, planning, and disaster management.
In recent years, the impact of climate change and unpredictable weather patterns has made accurate rainfall prediction more crucial than ever. Traditional meteorological methods, while effective to an extent, often struggle with real-time adaptability and handling large volumes of complex data. To address this, our Rainfall Prediction Website harnesses the power of Machine Learning (ML) to provide users with precise and timely rainfall forecasts based on historical and real-time data.

The website is designed to offer an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users—including farmers, researchers, and policymakers—to input relevant meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and location. Using advanced ML algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, the system analyzes patterns and predicts the likelihood and intensity of rainfall. These models are trained on historical weather datasets, improving accuracy over time as more data becomes available.

What sets this platform apart is its ability to adapt to regional variations and offer predictions with higher granularity. By utilizing data preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and model optimization, the website ensures robust performance across different geographical regions. The predictions are presented visually through charts and graphs, enabling better interpretation for end users.

This integration of machine learning into meteorological forecasting not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also contributes to disaster preparedness, agricultural planning, and water resource management. As the system evolves with ongoing training and feedback, the website aims to become a reliable tool in the realm of smart weather forecasting solutions.
